description: "Sitting down is no worse for you than standing up as long as you take regular exercise, a study has claimed, casting doubt on the health benefits of sit-stand work stations. The research by British academics also challenged advice from the country's National Health Service (NHS) based on other studies stating that \"remaining seated for too long is bad for your health, regardless of how much exercise you do\"."
